Fork this repo for a start point for yourself if u want to start basically with the base game.

Go to Nations.json and see where I copypasted a nation up to the top and edited a bunch of it's stuff.

First easy part is have the 'personality' be the leader name.  then go to Personalities.json and copypaste a leader and switch it's name to yours.

Ok so now back to Nations.json.  See all those 'uniques' i made?  Where do they come from?  Well you can open the game, go to settings, then all the way to the right to mod options, select a mod, and there we be an option to enter a 'uniques viewer'.  But i dont use that.  The easiest way is to find a mod or base game with a nation that does something similar to what you want, search for it, and see how it does it and copypaste.  What I use equslly with that is this site: https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Modders/uniques/ and that is where I chose these uniques.
