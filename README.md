Fork this repo for a start point for yourself if u want to start basically with the base game.

Go to Nations.json and see where I copypasted a nation up to the top and edited a bunch of it's stuff.

First easy part is have the 'personality' be the leader name.  then go to Personalities.json and copypaste a leader and switch it's name to yours.

Ok so now back to Nations.json.  See all those 'uniques' i made?  Where do they come from?  Well you can open the game, go to settings, then all the way to the right to mod options, select a mod, and there we be an option to enter a 'uniques viewer'.  But i dont use that.  The easiest way is to find a mod or base game with a nation that does something similar to what you want, search for it, and see how it does it and copypaste.  What I use equally with that is this site: https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Modders/uniques/ and that is where I chose these uniques.

Now our nation needs a unit and a building.  So go to Units.json and copypaste a unit you want to have a special version of up to the top.  I chose Chariot Archer.

Important to things are to say what it replaces and which empire it is unique to.  Then grab more uniques from dat site and unit done.  Now go to Buildings.json and do the same thing.

And that is literally it.

Feel free to branch out while doing this minimal first step.  Nations each have a favored religion too, which is basically just an icon and a name in the Religions.json.  Also you can do custom art for things, but that's another process about as long as this one which i bet i do differently than 'the suggested way'.  Core thing here was starting up a mod in a healthy state, initially making things, gaining comfort in the system, and coming out with a nation you can revisit and take into your real mod which you are now closer to starting (and can even start from this).  Enjoy!
